                <h1>Mardi Gras History</h1>
                <p>
                    The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the
                    17th and
                    18th
                    centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras,"
                    or fatted
                    calf,
                    followed France to her colonies.

                </p>
                <p>
                    On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a
                    plot of
                    ground 60
                    miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it
                    was the
                    eve of the
                    festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in
                    1702. In
                    1703, the
                    tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                    current
                    Mardi Gras
                    krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711
                    through
                    1861. The
                    procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would
                    parade with
                    an actual
                    bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in
                    New
                    Orleans, but not
                    with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
                    established elegant
                    society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                    governing
                    body. That
                    year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
                    carnival
                    organizations
                    formed in New Orleans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback
                    riders to
                    celebrate Mardi
                    Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each
                    event an
                    exciting air
                    of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus,
                    invoking John
                    Milton's
                    hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with
                    dazzling
                    floats (known
                    as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first
                    recorded
                    account of
                    Mardi Gras "throws."

                </p>
                <p>
                    Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
                    lithographs of
                    parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were always
                    carefully
                    guarded before
                    the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen.
                    But
                    beginning in 1886
                    with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced in full,
                    saturated
                    color,
                    doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A.
                    Wikstrom. Each
                    of these
                    designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who
                    for 40
                    years was
                    responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the
                    first
                    daytime
                    parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced
                    Romanoff's
                    family colors of
                    purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power; and
                    green
                    for faith.
                    This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love,"
                    was
                    cemented, due in
                    part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France,
                    culminating
                    with Comus'
                    magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic paper-mache' animal
                    costumes
                    served as
                    the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry
                    Warmoth. In
                    1875,
                    Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which
                    it
                    still is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private
                    social clubs
                    with
                    restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded by
                    their
                    members, New
                    Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"

                <h3>A Special Invitation From The Honorable LaToya Cantrell</h3>
                <p>
                    As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our city to experience the
                    excitement of Mardi Gras!

                    Mayor of New Orleans

                    The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
                    Twelfth Night or
                    Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.

                    Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
                    Carnival clubs,
                    called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors
                    quickly learn to
                    say, "Throw me something mister!"

                    The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid
                    & Pleasure Club and
                    the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the
                    fun-filled day of excitement
                    for revelers of all ages.

                    New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to
                    be at any time of
                    the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your
                    plans now to be a part
                    of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"


                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sincerely,

                        LaToya Cantrell
                        Mayor of New Orleans</strong>
                </p>

                <h3>LaToya Cantrell</h3>

                <p>
                    LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of
                    New Orleans,
                    Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before
                    becoming mayor, Cantrell
                    represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012 to 2018.
                </p>
                <p>Cantrell returned to New Orleans in 1999, settling in the Broadmoor neighborhood. In 2003, she joined
                    the board of the
                    Broadmoor Improvement Association and became president of the association in 2004. After the 2005
                    levee failures in
                    Greater New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, the Broadmoor neighborhood flooded severely and
                    remained mostly
                    deserted for months afterward. In early 2006, the Bring New Orleans Back Commission, a blue-ribbon
                    panel convened by
                    then-mayor Ray Nagin, released a recovery plan that called for Broadmoor and five other New Orleans
                    neighborhoods to be
                    converted into greenspace. In her role as president of the association, Cantrell worked with
                    residents and local
                    religious leaders to organize opposition to the panel's recommendation. She also helped enlist
                    returning Broadmoor
                    residents in a six-month effort to write a recovery plan for the neighborhood.</p>
                <p>
                    Cantrell worked full time to implement Broadmoor's recovery plan from 2006 through 2012. She and
                    fellow residents formed
                    the Broadmoor School Board, overseeing the reopening and renovation of the Andrew H. Wilson school.
                    She served as a
                    founding board member of the Broadmoor Development Corporation, a community development corporation
                    that provided case
                    management and other social services for returning residents. She was involved with residents'
                    efforts to reopen
                    Broadmoor's Rosa F. Keller Library, which won a $2 million grant from the Carnegie Endowment. She
                    created a
                    partnership between the Broadmoor Improvement Association and Church of the Annunciation, which
                    provided the
                    neighborhood association with office space and hosted volunteer groups. She also formed a
                    partnership between the
                    Broadmoor Improvement Association and her home parish, Blessed Trinity Catholic Church, to open the
                    Broadmoor Art and
                    Wellness Center.
