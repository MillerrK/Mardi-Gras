                            different
                            traditions mark the date of

                        <p>Mardi Gras parade krewes are private, non-profit organizations whose members get together
                            year
                            round to plan their
                            parade's theme, costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club, as they are known, is
                            individually funded by its
                            members. They support their krewe through dues, sales of krewe-related merchandise to
                            their
                            members, and fundraising.
                            Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes have corporate sponsors.

                            The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades; their only
                            involvement is to issue parade
                            permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that schedules and coordinates its own
                            parade.
